# Bank Account Simulator (Python CLI)

This is a simple **console-based banking simulator** written in Python. It allows users to create bank accounts, deposit money, withdraw funds, check their balance, and transfer money to other users â€” all in one run!

---

## Features

- Create a new bank account
- Deposit money with validation
- Withdraw money with insufficient balance check
- Check your current balance
- Transfer funds to other users (even create an account for the receiver on-the-fly!)
- Simple command-line interface

---

## How It Works

The program uses:
- Python classes to structure banking actions
- A class variable to store all users and their balances
- Input validation to avoid errors (e.g., negative transactions)
- A looped menu to allow multiple operations
